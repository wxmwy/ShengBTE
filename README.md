This is a very early copy of the code, please go to the official git to see the latest code. I just accelerated the calculation process of program hotspots and didn't understand the physical meaning. 

https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte/src/master/

## 1.Src-gpu is a GPU optimized version of ShengBTE.
We ported the three phonon process to the GPU.

## 2.Src-knl is a version for KNL(or other CPU with a big num cores).
We have carried out vectorization optimization and multithreading optimization, which can get a good running speed with a small number of processes.
A smaller number of processes means ShengBTE no longer requires a lot of memory.

## How to download, compile and use `ShengBTE`

Development of `ShengBTE` is hosted at [Bitbucket](https://www.bitbucket.org/). The latest version can be downloaded using the "download" link at [https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte](https://bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte). Alternatively, it is possible to clone its [GIT](http://git-scm.com/) repository from the command line with

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org/sousaw/shengbte.git ShengBTE
```

or from one of the many graphical frontends available.

To compile the code it is enough to run `make` in the `Src` subdirectory of the distribution, but a suitable `arch.make` must be present in that directory. An example is provided as `arch.make.example`. As a minimum, `$MPIFC` must contain a valid command to compile Fortran 90 code with MPI directives, while the combination of `$LDFLAGS` and `$LIBS` must contain any linker flags required in order to link against an implementation of `LAPACK` and against Atsushi Togo's [spglib](http://spglib.sourceforge.net/). ShengBTE uses some Fortran 2003 extensions, most notably its new syntax for array initialization, and a recent Fortran compiler is required that supports them; `gfortran` 4.8.2 and `ifort` 12.0.0 are known to work.

After compilation succeeds, a `ShengBTE` binary will be created in the root directory of the distribution. This executable takes no command-line options and accepts no input from the terminal. It can be invoked simply as

```bash
./ShengBTE
```

for serial mode, but most often it will be run using a command like

```bash
mpirun -n 32 ./ShengBTE 2>BTE.err >BTE.out
```

often as part of a script to be submitted to a batch system.

## Input files

Exactly three files are required for a `ShengBTE` run: `CONTROL`, one of `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND` or `espresso.ifc2`, and `FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD`. Their contents are detailed below; for a complete example, the reader is referred to the `Test-VASP` and `Test-QE` subdirectories of the distribution.

### The `CONTROL` file

The contents of this file describe the system to be studied and specify a set of parameters and flags controlling execution. Its format is merely a sequence of four Fortran [namelists](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/lnxpcomp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlf101l.doc%2Fxlflr%2Fnamelistio.htm), with a reasonably flexible syntax that should become apparent after looking at the example `Test-*/CONTROL` for zincblence InAs and GaAs. Some parameters and flags are mandatory, whereas others are optional and take a default value when unspecified.

- `&allocations` namelist:
    - `nelements` (integer, mandatory): number of different elements in the compound
    - `natoms` (integer, mandatory): number of atoms in the unit cell
    - `ngrid` (integer, 3, mandatory): number of grid planes along each axis in reciprocal space
    - `norientations` (integer, default=0): number of orientations along which to study nanowires
- `&crystal` namelist:
    - `lfactor` (real, nm, default=1.0): unit of measurement for lattice vectors
    - `lattvec` (real, 3 x 3, mandatory): real-space lattice vectors, in units of `lfactor`
    - `types` (integer, `natoms`, mandatory): a vector of `natom` integers, ranging from 1 to `nelements`, assigning an element to each atom in the system
    - `elements` (string, `nelements`, mandatory): a vector of element names
    - `positions` (real, 3 x `natoms`, mandatory): atomic positions in lattice coordinates
    - `masses` (real, `nelements`, g/mol, default=automatic): atomic masses corresponding to each element. If they are omitted and `autoisotopes` is true and the element names are known, they are computed automatically.
    - `gfactors` (real, `nelements`, default=automatic): g factors for isotopic scattering associated to each element. If they are omitted and `autoisotopes` is true and the element names are known, they are computed automatically.
    - `epsilon` (real, 3 x 3, &Epsilon;<sub>0</sub>, default=1): dielectric tensor of the system in the Cartesian basis
    - `born` (real, 3 x 3 x `natoms`, e, default=0): Born effective charge tensor of each atom in the Cartesian basis
    - `scell` (integer, 3, mandatory): supercell sizes along each crystal axis used for the 2nd-order force constant calculation
    - `orientations` (integer, 3 x `norientations`, mandatory unless `norientations`==0): terns of integer indices defining the crystallographic directions along which to study nanowires
- `&parameters` namelist:
    - `T` (real, K): temperature to be used in the case of single temperature calculation
    - `T_min`,`T_max`,`T_step` (real, K): the minimum temperature, the maximum temperature and the increment to be used for multiple-temperature calculation. T takes the priority if it is present. 
    - `omega_max` (real, rad/ps, default=1.e100): the max angular frequency up to which the anharmonic scattering properties are calculated for limited purposes. 
    - `scalebroad` (real, default=1.0): scale parameter for Gaussian smearing. The default is theoretically guaranteed to work, but significant speedups can sometimes be achieved by reducing it, with negligible loss of precision.
    - `rmin` (real, nm, default=5.0): minimum radius of nanowires whose thermal conductivity will be computed
    - `rmax` (real, nm, default=505.0): maximum radius of nanowires whose thermal conductivity will be computed
    - `dr` (real, nm, default=100.0): radius increment to be used when simulating nanowires from `rmin` to `rmax`
    - `maxiter` (integer, default=1000): maximum number of iterations allowed in the BTE convergence process
    - `nticks` (integer, default=100): number of different values of the mean free path at which to compute the cumulative thermal conductivity
    - `eps` (real, default=10<sup>-5</sup>): the iterative solver of the BTE will stop when the relative change in the thermal conductivity tensor is less than `eps`. Such change between steps n-1 and n is measured as ||&Kappa;<sub>n</sub>-&Kappa;<sub>n-1</sub>||, where ||&sdot;||  denotes a matrix 2-norm.
- `&flags` namelist:
    - `nonanalytic` (logical, default=.true.): compute and use the nonanalytic part of the dynamical matrix
    - `convergence` (logical, default=.true.): if true, iterate the BTE solver until convergence is achieved. If false, compute thermal conductivities in the relaxation time approximation.
    - `isotopes` (logical, default=.true.): include isotopic scattering in the relaxation times
    - `autoisotopes` (logical, default=.true.): compute atomic masses and g factors automatically
    - `nanowires` (logical, default=.false.): study the thermal conductivity of nanowires in addition to that of the bulk
    - `onlyharmonic` (logical, default=.false.): stop the program after computing the specific heat and small-grain thermal conductivity
    - `espresso` (logical, default=.false.): read second-order force constants from `espresso.ifc2` (Quantum Espresso format) instead of the default `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND` (Phonopy format)

### The `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND` file

This file contains the second derivatives of the system's energy with respect to the Cartesian coordinates of the nuclei, _i.e._ the interatomic force constant matrix. Its format is precisely that chosen in [Phonopy](http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/) for the `FORCE_CONSTANTS` file, so that the result of a Phonopy calculation can be used directly. The first line of the file declares the total number of atoms in the supercell, `npairs`, which must be equal to `scell(1)` x `scell(2)` x `scell(3)` x `natoms`, and is followed by `npairs` blocks of four lines each. The first line of each of those blocks contains two integers with the 1-based indices of the atoms forming the pair; the remaining three lines contain the 3 x 3 matrix of second-order interatomic force constants linking those two atoms, in eV/&Aring;<sup>2</sup>.

### The `espresso.ifc2` file

The information contained in this file is equivalent to that in `FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND`, but the format is different. For details, consult the [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/) documentation. Please note that although this file's header contains information about lattice vectors, atomic positions, Born effective charges and so forth, it is ignored by `ShengBTE`. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that `espresso.ifc2` and `CONTROL` are compatible.

### The `FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD` file

Similarly, this file contains the third-order interatomic force constant matrix, but uses a sparse description to save space. All constants are implicitily refered to a central unit cell i taken as the origin of coordinates. The first line again contains a single integer, `nb`, which is followed by `nb` blocks with the following structure:

- A blank line
- A 1-based sequential index
- A line with the Cartesian coordinates of the second unit cell in &Aring;
- A line with the Cartesian coordinates of the third unit cell in &Aring;
- A line with the 1-based indices of the three atoms involved, each from 1 to `natoms`
- 27 lines, each of which starts with a tern of integers specifying three Cartesian axes and is completed by a force constant in eV/&Aring;<sup>3</sup>. The last element of the tern changes first.

The following is an example of one such block:

## Output files

Many files including temperature-dependent directories are created during a successful run of `ShengBTE`. They contain not only the thermal conductivity and related quantities, but also a set of intermediate results that may be useful to diagnose problems. For some quantites, values only for the q points in the irreducible wedge are output, values for the rest can be recovered by looking into the equivilent points in the irreducible wedge.  This section includes a brief description of their contents.

- `BTE.ReciprocalLatticeVectors`: three reciprocal lattice basis vectors b1, b2 and b3 in nm-1. 
- `BTE.qpoints`: This file gives q points in the irreducible wedge of Brillouin zone (BZ), of which the relative coordinates with respect to the reciprocal lattice vectors are shown in the last 3 columns. The 1st and 2nd columns correspond the indices of those q points numbered in the irreducible wedge and in the whole Brillouin zone, respectively. The 3rd column lists the corresponding degeneracies. 
- `BTE.qpoints_full`: this file lists all q points in `ngrid(1)` x `ngrid(2)` x `ngrid(3)` &Gamma;-centered regular grid. The 1st column is a sequentially increasing index, the 2nd column contains the index of the equivalent irreducible q point numbered in the irreducible wedge, and the 3 remaining columns are the relative coordinates with respect to the reciprocal lattice vectors for the q point.
- `BTE.omega`: phonon angular frequencies of those q points in the irreducible wedge, in rad/ps.

- `BTE.pdos`: the phonon density of states projected on each atom in the unit cell (from the 2nd column on) vs the angular frequencies (1st column, in rad/ps)
- `BTE.P3`: volume in phase space available for three-phonon processes, for each irreducible q point and phonon band
- `BTE.P3_total`: sum of all the contributions in `BTE.P3`, total volume in phase space available for three-phonon processes
- `BTE.P3_plus*`, `BTE.P3_minus*`: equivalents of `BTE.P3` and `BTE.P3_total`, but including only contributions from emission (minus) or absorption (plus) processes
- `BTE.gruneisen`: Grüneisen parameter for each irreducible q point and phonon band
- `BTE.cvVsT`: specific heat of the system, in J/\(m<sup>3</sup> K) as a function of T (1st column)
- `BTE.gruneisenVsT_total`: total Grüneisen parameter obtained as a weighted sum of the mode contributions as a function of T (1st column)
- `BTE.KappaTensorVsT_sg`:  thermal conductivity tensor per unit of mean free path in the small-grain limit, in W/(m K nm) as a function of T (1st column). 
- `BTE.KappaTensorVsT_RTA`: total thermal conductivity tensor in unit of W/(m K) in the Relaxation Time Approximation (zero-order) as a function of T (1st column). 
- `BTE.KappaTensorVsT_CONV`: total CONVerged thermal conductivity tensor in unit of W/(m K) as a function of T (1st column). The last column gives the number of iterations reaching convergence.

Under temperature-dependent directories:

- `BTE.cv`: specific heat of the system, in J/\(m<sup>3</sup> K)
- `BTE.kappa_sg`: thermal conductivity per unit of mean free path in the small-grain limit, in W/(m K nm)
- `BTE.gruneisen_total`: total Grüneisen parameter obtained as a weighted sum of the mode contributions
- `BTE.WP3`: weighted phase space available for three-phonon processes  (in ps<sup>4</sup>rad<sup>-4</sup> , 2nd column) vs angular frequency (in rad/ps, 1st column) for those modes (q index changes first, and then band index) in the irreducible wedge. See [Phys. Rev. B 91, 144304 (2015)] for definition of weighted phase space.
- `BTE.WP3_plus`: WP3 contributed by phonon absorption processes alone

- `BTE.kappa_nw_*`: thermal conductivities of nanowires built along different directions of the bulk material, for different radii. The first column in each file is a diameter, the following 3 x `natoms` contain the contributions of each band and the last column contains the total thermal conductivity. Diameters are expressed in nm and conductivities in W/(m K)
- `BTE.kappa_nw_*_lower`: lower bounds to the thermal conductivities of nanowires built along different directions of the bulk material, for different radii. The first column in each file is a diameter, the following 3 x `natoms` contain the contributions of each band and the last column contains the total thermal conductivity. Diameters are expressed in nm and conductivities in W/(m K). Each lower bound is estimated by using the set of zeroth-order bulk relaxation times.
- `BTE.cumulative_kappa_*`: this set of files is analogous to `BTE.kappa*`, except in that their 1st column specifies a cutoff mean free path (in nm) when calculating the total contribution.
- `BTE.cumulative_kappaVsOmega_tensor`: this is analogous to `BTE.cumulative_kappa_tensor`, except in that the 1st column specifies a cutoff angular frequency (in rad/ps) when calculating the total contribution.
